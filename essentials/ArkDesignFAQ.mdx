**A10. Does Ark create buildings with curvilinear shapes?**

No, Ark currently does not support the creation of buildings with curvilinear shapes. It is designed to work with orthogonal shapes, but this feature may be introduced in the future as the platform develops.

**A11. What type of buildings can I create** with Ark?

Ark was initially created to design multi-family buildings, and its most unique capability is designing the typical floor plan for residential floors. It can generate designs for more than 50 apartments with the desired unit mix according to your input. However, in response to demand, we can now create mixed-use projects with different uses, including commercial, and community facilities, and we have even seen users hacking the system to create hotels, schools, single-family homes, and more.

**A12. Why can I not create more than 3 projects?**

You cannot create more than three projects because you are using the Lite version of Ark, which allows you to work on only three projects at a time and export a maximum of three PDF project reports.

**A13. What does the LITE version include?**

The Lite version of Ark includes the ability to work on up to three projects at a time, along with the option to export a maximum of three PDF project reports. It provides basic tools for creating automated floor plans and feasibility reports, but some advanced features may be limited compared to the full version.

**A14. What does the PRO version include?**

The Pro version of Ark includes the ability to create unlimited projects and export unlimited project report PDFs. It offers more advanced features compared to the Lite version and also allows you to download projects. However, Revit export is available only in the Enterprise version.

**B. PROPERTIES SCREEN**

**B1. What is “Zoning”? What is “Zoning District?**

Zoning is the process of dividing land into sections (or "zones") to regulate how the land can be used. It establishes rules for things like building types, allowed sizes, heights, densities, and the types of activities and uses allowed in each area (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). Zoning helps organize urban development, ensures safety, and promotes orderly growth by separating incompatible land uses (e.g., residential areas from factories).

**B2. How many stories should I insert?**

There is no limit to the number of stories you can insert in Ark. You can add as many as needed for your project. We recommend that you’ll start with the typical floor and create more floor types based on your typical floor settings.

**B3. What is the “unit system”?**

The unit system in Ark allows for flexibility: Imperial units are in feet and inches, while Metric units offer two options—millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)—to suit your project needs.

**B4. What is Imperial?**

The Imperial system is a unit of measurement commonly used in the United States and a few other countries. It includes units like feet, inches, yards, and miles for length; pounds and ounces for weight; and gallons and quarts for volume. In **Ark**, the **Imperial** system uses **feet** as the standard unit of length.

**B5. What is Metric?**

The Metric system is a decimal-based system of measurement used internationally, including in most countries around the world. It includes units such as meters (m) for length, kilograms (kg) for weight, and liters (L) for volume. In Ark, the Metric system allows you to use either millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm) as units of length.

**B6. What is “Maximum base height”?**

The base height of a building is the maximum permitted height of the front wall of a building before any required setback. A building is required to meet a minimum base height only when the height of the building will exceed the maximum base height.

**B7. What is “Minimum base height”?**

The base height of a building is the minimum permitted height of the front wall of a building before any required setback.

**B8. What is an “Anonymous Report”?**

An anonymous report is a report that is generated without revealing the identity of the user who created it. In Ark, it likely refers to a project report that can be exported or shared without any personal or account information being attached, maintaining the privacy of the user.

**C. LOT TYPE SCREEN**

**C1. What is the Interior Lot?**

A plot of land that is surrounded by other properties on all sides except for one, where it has access to a public or private street. These types of lots are often located within developed neighborhoods or areas with existing infrastructure. They don't have direct access to multiple streets or corners, but they do have street frontage on one side, which provides the necessary access for utilities, transportation, and entry into the property.

**C2. What is a Corner Lot?**

A piece of land that is located at the intersection of two streets, providing street frontage on both sides of the lot. This type of lot often offers more flexibility in terms of design and access compared to an interior lot, as it has two points of entry and additional visibility from two different streets.

**C3. What is 2 Corner Lot?**

A **double corner lot with three street sides** offers multiple access points, increased visibility, and design flexibility, making it ideal for large or mixed-use developments. It provides better natural light, ventilation, and higher property value. Key considerations include zoning, traffic, and privacy due to the three street frontages. This type of lot is well-suited for projects seeking optimal space and exposure.

**C4. What if I have a through lot?**

A **through lot** has street access on both the front and rear sides, offering increased accessibility and design flexibility. It’s ideal for larger projects, with the potential for multiple entry points and better traffic flow. In order to design, use the interior lot layout and add a street on the rear side to maximize space and flow. Key considerations include zoning, setbacks, and maintaining privacy due to the dual street access.

**C5. What should I select if I have a complex zoning lot that combines several zoning lots?**

For a **complex zoning lot** that combines several zoning lots, select a **"zoning consolidation"** approach. This treats the combined area as a single zoning lot, allowing for unified design and development. Consider zoning regulations, setbacks, and legal requirements to optimize the project's potential across the merged lot.

**C6. What if I have an irregular lot?** 

If you have an irregular lot,You can select of the lot types templates and edit the particular site conditions in the next sceen (Lot Editor).

**C7. Which lot type shall I choose for an irregular shape lot?**

If you have an irregular lot, you can select the lot type templates and edit the particular site conditions on the next screen (Lot Editor).

**~~C8. How can I select the lot type?~~**

**~~OR~~**

**~~Based on what parameters should I select the lot type?~~**

**~~OR~~**

**~~What is an “Inner lot”, “Corner lot” and “Tow corner lot”?~~**

~~Choose the lot type based on street access: select **corner lot** if it’s at the intersection of two streets, **two-corner lot** if it has three street frontages, **through lot** if it has access to both a front and back street, or **interior lot** if it’s surrounded by other properties with no street access on the back or sides. The key factor is the number of street frontages, not the shape.~~

* **What is a corner lot?**  
  A corner lot is a lot located at the intersection of two streets.  
* **What is a two-corner lot?**  
  A two-corner lot has frontages on three streets.  
* **What is a through lot?**  
  A through lot has access to both a front and back street.  
* **What is an interior lot?**  
  An interior lot is surrounded by other properties and has no street access on the back or sides.

**D. LOT EDITOR SCREEN**

#### **What is the Lot Editor tool in ARK?**

The Lot Editor tool creates a smart lot configuration that lays the foundation for ARK to automatically generate floor plates. You would be able to input the project lot line and edit every type of lot line, ARK would define each type of lot line so you could edit even the most complex irregular lots.

#### **How can I insert adjacent buildings in the Lot Editor?**

Along the side lot lines, you could insert the massing of the adjacent buildings (Height/width/length and distance from lot line) so that the surrounding massing would affect the ARK automated design offer and the project’s 3D massing model.

The Lot Editor Tool offers extensive capabilities for defining and customizing various lot configurations, including dimensions, shapes, lot types, and street 

1. Choose Lot Type

Users can choose different lot types:

* Interior  
* Corner  
* two corner lot.

      2\.   Lot Editor  
designations. The Lot Editor enables editing to more complex lot types like through lots or combinations of several lots.

* Left Panel Editing:

Lot dimensions can be adjusted either through the left panel or directly on the main screen.

* Start by inputting lot dimensions on the left panel for the larger dimensions.  
* Lot Input Insertion:  
* Subsequent modifications can be made to the lot conditions based on these dimensions in the main panel in more detail.  
* It is recommended to locate the longer street wall at the bottom of the screen.  
* In the inner lot case, locate the street lot line at the bottom of the screen.  
* In the corner lot case, locate the longer street lot line at the bottom of the screen.  
* In the two corner lot case, locate the middle street lot line of the building’s U shape at the bottom of the screen.   
* Editing Lot Types and Lines:  
  * Users can change the lot type and modify every lot line type.

Splitting Lot Line:

Editing involves clicking on the lot line, clicking on the new vertices, and splitting the lot, moving the vertices and creating complex and/or irregular shapes.

#### **How does the Lot Editor maintain angle precision?**

**Red dotted lines** indicate **90-degree angles** between lot lines to ensure precision.

#### **What tools are available for lot modification?**

**Pen Tool**: Allows users to **change the lot line type**.

* **Side Lot Lines**: Users can **add adjacent buildings** with height and distance specifications.  
* **Street Lot Line**: Users can update if the **street is wide or narrow** and **add the street name**.  
* **Rear lot line**

**D1. Can I rotate a building shape at Ark?** 

No, for now, Ark can’t rotate the building shape. Therefore, when planning a new project, ensure that you rotate the building so that in an interior lot, the street wall is always at the bottom of the screen. For a corner lot, position the street corner at the bottom of the screen. In cases of 2 corner lots, the middle street wall should be at the bottom of the screen, and the middle portion of the planned U shape should also be at the bottom of the screen.

**D2. How can I split a lot line and create a polygon-shaped lot?**

* Select the lot line  
* Click on the Split point (Mid-point)  
* Select the split point and move it to create the shape

**D3. How to set the lot line for a diagonal shape?**

The bottom lot line of the lot shape must be horizontal, as AI Generate will only create templates when the bottom line is horizontal.

**D4. What shall I do if I have an irregular lot?** 

If you have an **irregular lot**, define the **street, side, and rear lot lines**, noting if the **street is narrow or wide** with its **name**. Specify the **adjacent building’s width, depth, height**, and **distance from the lot line** to ensure proper spacing and compliance.

**D5. How shall I insert the site conditions for an irregular lot?**

For an **irregular lot**, site conditions should be inserted by defining the **street lot line, side lot line, and rear lot line** accurately. Specify whether the **street is narrow or wide**, include its **name**, and mark its connection to the lot. Clearly indicate the **adjacent building's width, depth, height**, and its **distance from the lot line** to ensure proper spacing. This helps in planning the layout effectively while maintaining zoning compliance and site usability.

**D6. What is a “Street lot line”?**

A ***street lot line***, also known as a front lot line, is that portion of a zoning lot line that fronts upon a street.

**D7. What is a “Side lot line”?**

A ***side lot line***\* is any lot line that is neither a front lot line nor a rear lot line.

**D8. What is a “Rear lot line”?**

A ***rear lot line*** is any lot line that is generally parallel to a street line bounding the zoning lot and does not intersect a street line.

**D9. What is an "Adjacent building”?**

In **ARK**, an **adjacent building** can be added in the **Lot Editor** under **site details** while planning. This allows you to define key parameters such as **width, depth, and height** of the adjacent structure. Additionally, you can specify its **distance from the lot line** and its **proximity to the main building** to ensure proper spacing and compliance with zoning or design regulations. These details help in visualizing the site's layout.

**E. TYPICAL FLOOR SCREEN**

Locate and edit schematic shapes of the typical floor. 

As a result of the zoning page input and the lot editor settings from the previous stage, ARK would provide the floor plate shape and dimension based on the schematic typical floor and place it in the optimal location on the property.

This design can be moved and relocated anywhere on the lot, as well as the shape/configuration and dimensions of the floor plate can be changed.

If the floor plate exceeds the lot boundaries, ARK warns by highlighting the floor plate with pink if it exceeds the lot lines.

A. Locate Typical:

* Initial Recommendations:  
  * The system suggests a layout with specific shape, dimensions, and location for the typical floor.  
  * It’s noted that this suggested shape, size and location can be altered and customized.  
* Changing the Shape and dimensions on the left panel:  
  * Users have the ability to modify the layout shape.  
  * Alternative shapes include:   
  * an infill rectangle with two side lot line walls and corner rectangles/ L shape for corner lots/ U shape for 2 corners lot.  
  * Wall Dimensions Arrangements:  
    * Designing a double-loaded core door U shape, requiring the arms of the U to be deep for corridors.  
  * Applying Changes:  
    * Once modifications are made, they can be applied to the floor layout.

 Moving the floor plate:

On the main panel, grab the floor plate and moving it, using the ruler tool

B. Core Selection 

This process involves creating a typical floor before customizing its shape and dimensions to meet specific requirements. 

On the left panel:

 The system would suggest the number of stairs and elevators

The system would inform the units area

*  The user would need to insert the “Minimum Room Width”, this is the length of every legal room along the window wall.  
* The user would need to insert the “Minimum RoomDepth”, this is the minimum depth of the legal rooms.

On the main panel:

The user would select the preferred core layout that would become the basis for the design.

**E1. At the ‘Locate Typical' screen because the dimensions I inserted, the building turns red, What should I do?**

**OR**

**I would like to create a different shape for the building, what can i do?**

Ensure that every dimension line falls within the appropriate ranges the app provides. If a dimension line exceeds the allowed range, it will turn red, indicating that you need to adjust the dimension line to fit within the specified range.

**E2. My building consists of different floor shapes for each floor, what shape should I select?**

We always recommend to start with the Typical floor shape of the building, later on in the process, you can create more floor types and customize for every floor like your ground floor and different set-back floors.

**E3. At the “Locate Typical” screen, Why does the floor plan turn red?**

When designing the floor plan, please ensure that the floor shape fits within the lot size. If the floor shape exceeds the lot size, it will turn red, and you will need to adjust the shape dimensions. If you would like the building to be located within the lot boundaries.

**E4. How can I set the floor shape?**

* At the “Typical floor” screen, you will create the typical floor template:  
* \-Select the desired shape in the left panel.  
* \-Set the shape dimensions.  
* \-Once all dimensions are done, and then click on "Next”.  
* At the "Typical floor Selection" screen:  
* Click on the template of your choice.  
* Click on "Generate."  
* At the "Schematic Section" screen, click on the pen tool to open the Floor Editor.

**E5. Why does the building shape that the software offers turn red and protrude beyond the lot line after setting the lot conditions?** 

Ark primarily works with templates for multi-family buildings, focusing on medium to larger-scale projects. Many users attempt to create small-scale projects with different uses that were not intended for design with Ark. Therefore, whenever you try to set the shape, the system provides appropriate dimensions for medium-sized multi-family projects. You can try setting it to the minimum range and then adjust it to your preferred configuration after generating the building.

**E6. How do you use the dimension tool in ArkDesign.AI?**

* Go to top menu, Select ‘Measure’ tab  
* ‘Select Create dimension’ tool  
* Click on specific endpoint to measure  
* Press and hold the ‘Shift’ key to create diagonal measurements.  
* Select the dimensions line then grab and move to set the position.  
* Use the Hide/Unhide tool from the upper bar.  
* Press the control key to select multiple dimensions and it can be removed.

**E7. How can I move the building shape within the lot?**

To move the building shape within the lot, first select the building shape from the available options. Then, adjust its dimensions to match the lot size. After that, simply grab the building shape and move it to fit within the lot as desired.

**E8. How can I place the building within the site?**

To place the building within the site, first select the building shape from the available options. Then, adjust its dimensions to fit the site. Once the dimensions are set, grab the building and move it to the desired location on the site to ensure it fits properly within the boundaries.

**E9. How can I create an irregular floor plan?**

To create an irregular floor plan, start with a basic rectangular shape and split the walls by at least 10 feet in different directions. Move the walls orthogonally (at 90-degree angles) to break up the space, creating jagged edges and non-linear sections. Add protrusions and indentations by shifting walls inward or outward to form asymmetrical areas. Continue adjusting and splitting walls to maintain irregularity while ensuring logical flow and functional connections between spaces. This method will give you an irregular, unique layout while keeping the design practical.

**F. TYPICAL FLOOR SELECTION SCREEN**

**F1. When selecting the design option at the “Typical floor Selection” screen, all I see is the green area of the lot, and I cannot see the building floor plan. Could you please explain?**

Ark was created to work on urban-scale projects with a limited 300' elevation. If your input is a larger-scale project, the floorplate would be so small that it might not be visible under certain conditions.

**F2. The vertical cores placement layouts that the system generated are not similar to the layout of the building I am planning, how should I proceed?**

We always recommend to start with one of the templates that the system offers and than amending it by adding or moving the components 

**G. SCHEMATIC SECTION SCREEN**

From the schematic section of the building generated by the system, you could control the entire  3D massing.

The left panel contains the building information area tables. The pen tool on the lower right would lead you to the floor plan editor for designing each floor. Add more types of typical/setback/commercial/cellar floors, and redesign each floor with the floor plan editor

* Select the floor.  
* In the left panel, change the floor height.

**G2. How does the Deduction feature work?**

The deduction feature can be edited by clicking on the settings icon in the left panel and is applicable mostly to NYC. As Ark was initially created for NYC, the NYC zoning resolution allows deductions of eligible areas to be excluded from the building zoning area, thereby increasing the permitted floor area. If you are in NYC or in a metro area that uses deductions, you can calculate the deductions by percentage or square footage for every floor type. Once you have updated the deductions, you can save and close and then view your zoning area calculations in the area tables.

**G3. How to create new floor type and group?**

To begin, select the floor type and go to the "Create" menu. Then, click on "Add Floor Type." Enter the name of your desired floor type and click "Create." This will create your new floor type.

If you'd like to add more floors, simply select the floor type again and click the “+” icon to add additional floors.

Once you're ready to make adjustments, click the pen icon to open the floor editor. Here, you can modify the layout—for example, if you need to create a setback. To do this, select all units from the area where the setback is needed and remove them. Next, select the exterior wall and move it to form the setback.

**G4. Ark Schematic section is not showing me the right section, why is that?**

We just call it a schematic section but it is actually the side diagram of the building that would help you manage and navigate the design of different floors of your project.

**G5. I tried to create a new floor type but the system doesn't let me, could you please explain?**

To create a new floor type from an existing one, you need to select either the **top floor** or **bottom floor** from the floor types. First, double-click on the **top floor** or **bottom floor** to select it. Then, click on the **double arrow** to create a new floor type. After that, write the name of your new floor type and click on **Create**. This will create your new floor type based on the selected existing one.

**G6. Which floors can be edited to new floor type?**

To create a new floor type, double-click on either the **top floor** or **bottom floor** from the existing floor types. Then, click the **double arrow** to create a new floor type. After naming it, click **Create** to finalize the process. This will generate a new floor type based on the selected one.

**G7. At what stage is it recommended to create a cellar floor?**

In ARK, the most recommended step is to first create the **ground floor** and then create the **cellar floor**. This approach ensures that the layout is properly established, allowing you to add the cellar floor with the correct positioning in relation to the ground floor.

**H. FLOOR EDITOR SCREEN**

This tool set offers a robust platform for designing mixed-use spaces within a building, allowing intricate adjustments and detailed modifications to suit specific functions or purposes for each area within the structure.

* Select the Enclose area tool (![][image1]) from the upper bar.  
* Create a wall from wall to wall. make sure that the new space is enclosed, otherwise, it will disappear.  
* \-Create a wall from one wall to another. Ensure that the new space is enclosed; otherwise, it will disappear.

**H3. I’ve built a wall but it got erased, could you please explain?**

Ark cannot build just a wall; the app's wall-building tool creates an enclosed space with the walls that you have constructed. When creating a new area, please ensure that the new wall is enclosed by other walls; otherwise, it may disappear.  

**H4.  How can we use the Plan Apartments tool?**

On the Floor Editor screen, click on the TBD area or any other type of area.

Change the Use to “Residential” and the Type to “AI Generate” in the left panel.

Click on AI Generate button in the left panel.

Plan Unit Mix:

The feature calculates the number of legal rooms along the window walls and shows you the total number of rooms and the maximum available area.

Fill the Unit mix data as per the requirement by percentage and/or the number and type of units for every floor. Remember, the total number of rooms should not exceed the total number of available rooms; otherwise, it will not generate the plan.

**H5. How can I edit an apartment?**

We have different modes of editing unit types and areas:

Select the wall and move it; the number of rooms will adjust automatically.

Select the room and remove it, then click on the Recalculate tool from the upper bar. It will calculate the number of rooms and adjust the unit type automatically.

Press the Ctrl key, select multiple units, and click on the Merge unit icon in the upper bar. It will merge the units.

**H6. How to create the set-back floors and different types of floors at Ark?**

**OR**

**If I would like several of the units to be stacked below or several demising walls to be stacked below for better constructability, how should I approach the setback process?**

Floor type refers to one or more floors that are identical. When you use the floor below layout, the system allows you to edit it for setbacks and design iterations so that the unaffected areas and units stay stacked to the floors below, thereby increasing design efficiency.

To add a new floor type:

* Go to the schematic section screen.  
* Select the floor.  
* Click on the ‘+’ icon to add a new floor type.  
* Double-click on the new floor. To convert more floors to the new type, press (Ctrl \+ Select).

To create setback:

* Go to the floor editor of the new setback floor.  
* Move the wall inside to create the setback of the floor.  
* To move only a portion of the wall, split the wall and adjust it accordingly.

**H7. Can I plan apartments in the cellar?**

You technically cannot plan apartments in the cellar, as legal rooms require legal windows to comply with light and air regulations. The cellar floor is below ground level and therefore does not have default window walls. However, you can have areaways open below and plan your apartment windows manually by following these steps:

* Go to the cellar Floor Editor.  
* Select outer walls and change the wall type to glass walls from the upper bar.  
* Select the area.  
* In the left panel, choose Use \- Residential and Type \- AI Generate.

**H11. How to plan a Blank template in the ArkDesignAI app?**

Let's plan your project floor layout with our AI tool. This one-minute video will show you how to use our AI tool.

On the schematic section screen, use the Pen Tool to modify the floor plan.  

Add a corridor to ensure that the unit areas you are planning have access to egress.

Units need window walls for legal light and air. If you have a block wall, switch to a window wall.

Add stairs and elevator cores to your project.

Make sure that these cores are connected to corridor walls.

Click on the "AI Generate" button to use our Distribution Tool to plan your unit mix. You can plan using our percentage feature or by number of rooms.

Ensure the number of rooms doesn’t exceed the maximum limit.  

Once satisfied, click on 'Apply Selected’ to go back to your floor plan to make final adjustments.  

Always check that all mandatory conditions are met in order for the AI tool to work effectively\!

**H12. Can we use the build wall tool to make changes in the ARK app after generating units?**

The wall tool doesn't work on planned unit areas.

**H13. How do you create multiple towers with different heights?**

* Go to floor editor  
* Press the Ctrl key and select multiple units then remove from where you need to split the building.  
* Select the wall and move to split the area.  
* Go to the schematic section  
* Select the tower and rename the building from the left panel.  
* Select the building and create a new floor type  
* Select new floor type and go to floor editor  
* Delete all units from one building that you want to increase or decrease the floors.  
* Delete all core components from that floor.  
* Go to the schematic section  
* Select one of the buildings and add a new floor type.

**H14. How do you delete all units at once?**

* Go to the floor editor screen  
* Press the ‘Ctrl’ key and select multiple units  
* Right-click and Remove

**H15. How to resolve the Gap issue in the plan?**

Select the core component (Staircase) and attach it to the aligned wall for access.

**H16. Move/rotate core when there is no floor above or below?**

To add a new core component, such as a stair, follow these steps:

* Select the stair component and place it in the floor layout.  
* Assign the stairs to the affected floor type.  
* If you need to rotate the stair, first select it, right-click, and a popup will appear with the "Rotate" option. Click that to rotate the stairs as needed.  
* If you'd like to move the stairs to a different position in the floor layout, select and grab it to move it.

Make sure to check if the floor layouts above or below the current floor layout match in order to place the stairs correctly. If they do, the stairs can be placed in that position. Otherwise, it won't be possible to place the stairs there.

**I. PLAN UNIT MIX SCREEN**

**I1. What is the minimum room width and depth?**

Minimum Room Width and depth are inputs for determining the average minimum room dimensions. You can set these values on the “Plan Unit Mix” screen for the entire selected area.

The default average minimum room dimensions in the app are 110 inches in width (along the window wall) by 120 inches in depth. Ensure that your dimensions do not exceed the allowed range set by the app.

**I2. In the plan apartments tool, is the unit mix for the entire building or only for the floor type?**

The unit mix works separately for every floor type.

The unit mix represents the number of each apartment type (1 bed/2 bed, etc.) and in Ark, it is calculated per floor for every floor type.
